Audio-Synthesizer
=================
This is an assignment for my Computer Audio class.  Using Webkit's Web Audio API, the application imitates a sound synthesizer.

Features:
- Sine, Sawtooth, Square, and Triangle waveforms
- Noise
- Pitch
- ADSR envelopes to each note
- Ring Modulation
- High/Low/Band Pass Filters
- Master Volume control

To run the application, just open "audiosynth.html".  You must be running this in Google Chrome or Safari since it uses Webkit's Web Audio API.
